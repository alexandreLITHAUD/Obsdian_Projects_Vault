Creating a simple “copycat” of Git in Go is an excellent way to understand how Git works internally. At its core, Git is a distributed version control system that uses a few key concepts and data structures:

1. Git’s Object Model

Blobs: These represent file data. When you add a file, Git creates a blob for its contents.

Trees: These represent directories. A tree object contains pointers to blobs (files) and other trees (subdirectories).

Commits: A commit object records a snapshot of the tree, along with metadata such as the author, commit message, and pointers to parent commits.

Tags: These are pointers to commits that can be used to mark releases or important milestones.


Git stores all these objects in a content-addressable storage system where each object is identified by its SHA-1 (or SHA-256 in newer versions) hash. This means that even a slight change in the content produces a different hash, ensuring integrity and efficient storage.

2. How Git Works in Practice

Snapshot-Based Versioning: Unlike systems that track file differences, Git creates snapshots of the entire repository state. When you commit changes, Git stores a new snapshot, reusing the unchanged blobs from previous commits.

Branching and Merging: Branches in Git are simply pointers to commits. Merging involves creating a new commit that has more than one parent, representing the convergence of development lines.

Distributed Nature: Every clone of a Git repository is a full-fledged repository with complete history, allowing users to work offline and sync changes later.


3. Implementing a Minimal Git in Go

When building a simple version of Git in Go, consider the following components:

Object Creation and Storage:

Write functions to hash file contents using SHA-1.

Store these blobs in an object database (for simplicity, you can use the file system under a directory like .mygit/objects).


Tree Construction:

Recursively traverse directories to build tree objects that list file names, types, and associated blob hashes.


Commit Creation:

Build commit objects that include pointers to tree objects, author information, commit messages, and parent commit hashes.

Serialize these commit objects, hash them, and store them.


Basic Commands:

Init: Create the directory structure (similar to .git).

Add: Hash and store file contents as blobs.

Commit: Create a tree from the current state, then a commit pointing to that tree.



4. Learning Resources and Existing Projects

Understanding Git Internals:
Books like Pro Git provide an excellent deep dive into Git’s design.

Existing Projects:
Look at projects such as go-git, a pure Go implementation of Git. Even though it is more complete than a simple prototype, its source code is a valuable resource for understanding how to structure your own implementation.

Tutorials and Blog Posts:
There are several online tutorials that walk through building a simple version control system in Go. These can help illustrate how to structure your code and handle the storage/retrieval of objects.


5. Practical Steps to Get Started

6. Set Up Your Project Structure: Create a folder (e.g., .mygit) to hold your objects.


7. Implement Object Storage: Write functions for:

Computing SHA-1 hashes.

Writing objects to files named after their hash.



3. Create the Data Structures: Define Go structs for blobs, trees, and commits. Implement serialization (and optionally compression) similar to Git’s pack files.


4. Develop Command-Line Tools: Start with simple commands like init, add, and commit to interact with your version control system.


5. Iterate and Test: Build small prototypes and test with simple repositories to verify that your objects are created and referenced correctly.



By focusing on these components, you’ll gradually build an understanding of how Git manages data and can create a simplified version of its functionality. This exercise not only reinforces programming skills in Go but also provides valuable insights into how modern version control systems work under the hood.

For more detailed examples and discussions, check out articles and repositories from developers who have attempted similar projects. This real-world exploration can be particularly helpful in bridging theory with practice. 




Yes, every file in Git is represented by a blob object that has its own SHA-1 hash computed from its content. When you add a file to Git, the content is hashed, and that hash becomes the identifier for that particular version of the file. If the file changes, its new content produces a different hash, and this change is reflected in the tree object of the commit. In essence:

Blob Object: Each file's content is stored as a blob with a SHA hash.

Tree Object: The tree object contains entries for each file (and directory), including the file’s mode, name, and the corresponding blob’s SHA.

Commit Object: A commit records a snapshot of the repository by referencing the root tree’s SHA.


This mechanism allows Git to efficiently determine if a file has changed, since any alteration in content produces a different hash, causing the tree (and subsequently the commit) to differ. 




Git’s design might seem counterintuitive at first, but it stores more than just a SHA. The SHA-1 (or SHA-256) is simply a unique identifier for an object. In the case of a file, Git creates a blob object that includes both a header (which describes the object type and size) and the actual file content. When you revert to a commit, Git follows these steps:

Lookup: The commit points to a tree, and each tree entry references a blob by its SHA.

Retrieval: Git uses the SHA to locate the blob object in its object database (usually within the .git/objects directory).

Decompression: The blob object is stored in a compressed format. Git decompresses it to retrieve the original file content.


So while you see only a SHA in the tree or commit, that SHA is the key to finding the stored blob, which contains everything needed to reconstruct the file exactly as it was at that commit. This mechanism is what allows Git to track changes and restore previous versions reliably. 





Yes, trees in Git are objects just like blobs and commits, and they each have their own SHA hash. When Git creates a tree, it constructs a list of entries (files and subdirectories), each with its mode, name, and associated object’s SHA (either a blob or another tree). This list, along with a header indicating that it’s a tree and its size, is then hashed. That hash uniquely identifies the tree object and is stored in Git’s object database. This mechanism allows Git to track changes in the directory structure over time. 




Yes, you can use JSON or YAML to serialize a tree structure for your Git-like system in Go. However, Git itself uses a binary format for efficiency. If you want to keep things simple, your tree structure in JSON might look like this:

{
  "tree": [
    {
      "type": "blob",
      "name": "file1.txt",
      "sha": "abc123..."
    },
    {
      "type": "tree",
      "name": "subdir",
      "sha": "def456..."
    }
  ]
}

Each entry contains:

Type: Either "blob" (file) or "tree" (directory).

Name: The filename or directory name.

SHA: The hash of the blob (file contents) or sub-tree (directory contents).


Considerations:

1. Pros of JSON/YAML:

Human-readable and easy to debug.

Simple to implement with Go’s encoding/json or gopkg.in/yaml.v3.



2. Cons:

Not as space-efficient as Git’s binary format.

Slower to parse compared to Git’s native method.




Alternative: Git-Like Binary Encoding

If you want a more Git-like approach, you could concatenate:

mode name\0SHA

where mode is the Unix file mode, and \0 separates entries.

For storing objects (blobs, trees, commits) easily, you need a structured way to save them while keeping retrieval efficient. Here’s a simple way to do it:

1. Directory-Based Storage (Like Git)

Store objects in a .mygit/objects/ directory.

Use the SHA-1 (or SHA-256) hash as the filename.

Split the hash into a folder structure for better performance (e.g., ab/cdef123... for SHA abcdef123...).


Example:

.mygit/
  objects/
    ab/
      cdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12
    de/
      f01234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234

2. File Format for Objects

Each object is stored with:

Header: Type (blob, tree, commit) and size.

Content: Actual file data (for blobs) or structured references (for trees and commits).

Compression (Optional): Git uses zlib compression for efficiency.


Blob Example (Text File)

Stored in .mygit/objects/ab/cdef123...

blob 14\0Hello, world!

Where:

blob 14\0 → Header (type: blob, size: 14 bytes)

Hello, world! → File content


Tree Example

Stored in .mygit/objects/de/f01234...

040000 tree abc123... subdir
100644 blob def456... file1.txt

Where:

040000 tree abc123... subdir → A directory (subdir) pointing to a tree object.

100644 blob def456... file1.txt → A file (file1.txt) pointing to a blob.


3. Commit Format

commit 123\0
tree f01234...
parent abcdef...
author Alice <alice@example.com> 1712141923 +0200
message Initial commit

This commit points to a tree (f01234...), an optional parent (for previous commits), and includes metadata.

Alternative: JSON/YAML for Simplicity

If you prefer JSON, you can store objects like this:

Blob (File)

{
  "type": "blob",
  "content": "Hello, world!"
}

Tree (Folder)

{
  "type": "tree",
  "entries": [
    { "mode": "100644", "type": "blob", "sha": "def456...", "name": "file1.txt" },
    { "mode": "040000", "type": "tree", "sha": "abc123...", "name": "subdir" }
  ]
}

Commit

{
  "type": "commit",
  "tree": "f01234...",
  "parent": "abcdef...",
  "author": "Alice <alice@example.com>",
  "message": "Initial commit"
}

JSON is readable but inefficient compared to Git’s raw binary format.

Which Method Should You Use?

For learning and debugging: JSON/YAML is great.

For performance and real-world use: Git’s storage method (binary blobs, SHA-based storage) is much better.
